**vistavkinamm/vistavkinamm** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning at GeekBrains. And soon I will become a cool testing engineer!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data sciene, machine learning.
